updated info.c based on grading of part1

added changes.c which handles 
	-command line switches; -e computer readable output, -h human readable output and -m the amount of moves to process
	-checks if moves from input are valid
	-moves pieces on the board if move is valid
	-outputs to -e or -h file (if switch is supplied)
	-if capture is on and it is possible to capture a piece but it is not captured that move is returned as illegal

updated the make file to handle both c files

the resulting board placement from the amount of moves processed is outputed to the -e or -h file (if supplied)



example to execute program:
./changes < input.txt -m 2 -h humanOut.txt
