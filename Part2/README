updated info.c based on grading of part1

added changes.c which handles 
	-command line switches -e -h and -m
	-checks if moves from input are valid
	-moves peices on the board if move is valid
	-outputs to -e or -h file if supplied
	-if capture is on and a possible to capture a piece exists but is not taken the move is returned as illegal

updated the make file to handle both c files
