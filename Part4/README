added edit.c which uses the information from info and changes to output a gui to the terminal.
	the terminal outputs:
		the hot keys the user can use
		the current state of the board based on the cursor which can be moved by the right and left arrow keys
		all moves in the input file colored by validity, green is valid, red is invalid and white is unknown.

edit also accounts for if capture is on and highlights the move if a move could take a piece but didn't in red

make file was updated to include edit.c and termbox
